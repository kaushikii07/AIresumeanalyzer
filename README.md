# AIresumeanalyzer
AI Resume Analyzer, an intelligent Streamlit-based web application that helps job seekers evaluate and improve their resumes with the power of Google Gemini AI. ðŸ“„âœ¨

This tool analyzes uploaded resumes, compares them with job descriptions, calculates ATS scores, and even provides personalized feedback and course recommendations to bridge skill gaps. It supports OCR for scanned resumes, uses interactive visualizations (Plotly) for insights, and offers an engaging user interface with animated progress bars, custom CSS, and real-time feedback.

What sets it apart? It doesn't just analyze â€” it educates. Users get actionable suggestions, tailored learning paths, and recruiter-style feedback to improve their chances in competitive hiring systems. This project combines AI, NLP, and intuitive UI/UX to make resume building smarter and more effective.
